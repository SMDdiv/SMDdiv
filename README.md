## 🧠 About Me  
I'm a **Computer Science student (2026)** specializing in building **real-world AI systems** — from Agentic RAG pipelines to Computer Vision models deployed on edge devices.

I focus on solving impactful problems through:
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- RAG & LLM Engineering  
- Computer Vision & Edge AI  
- FastAPI, Streamlit, and modern AI backends  

I enjoy creating intelligent, production-oriented systems that combine **AI + IoT + RAG + Vision** into practical tools.
